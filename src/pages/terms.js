                <p>
                  These terms of use, their subject matter and their formation
                  (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by
                  Barbados law. We both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of
                  the courts of Barbados. If any provision hereof is declared by
                  any judicial or other competent authority to be illegal or
                  otherwise unenforceable, such provision shall be severed from
                  these terms. The remaining provisions of these terms shall
                  continue in full force and effect and such severance shall not
                  (to the greatest possible extent) affect the validity or
                  operation of any other provision of these terms. These terms
                  constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
                  the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all prior
                  agreements, representations and understandings of the parties
                  in connection with the subject matter hereof.
