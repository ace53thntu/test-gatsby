            <p>
              CloudSolar is the Caribbean's first Green Technology company that
              allows users to purchase a solar panel digitally which creates
              investment in the solar sector of Barbados. Our community solar projects convert
              clean energy from the sun into electricity that is used to power
              the Barbados electrical grid.
